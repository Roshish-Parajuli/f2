They allow you to programmatically access data from various sources.\n\n## Types of APIs\n\nThere are several types of APIs, but the most common are:\n\n*   **REST APIs:** These are the most common type of API. They are based on the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style.\n*   **GraphQL APIs:** These are a newer type of API that is gaining popularity. They allow you to request only the data you need, which can be more efficient than REST APIs.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nAPIs can be used for a variety of tasks, including:\n\n*   Extracting data from sources that don't have a direct database connection.\n*   Building data pipelines that are triggered by events.\n*   Integrating with third-party services.\n"},{"slug":"data-extraction-101","title":"Data Extraction 101","description":"Data extraction is the process of retrieving data from various sources.

This means that you don't have to define a schema before you store the data.\n*   **Scalability:** Data lakes are designed to be highly scalable. You can store petabytes of data in a data lake.\n*   **Flexibility:** Data lakes can store data in any format, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nData lakes are used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n*   Big data analytics\n*   Machine learning\n*   Real-time data processing\n"}]
