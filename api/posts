They allow you to programmatically access data from various sources.\n\n## Types of APIs\n\nThere are several types of APIs, but the most common are:\n\n*   **REST APIs:** These are the most common type of API. They are based on the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style.\n*   **GraphQL APIs:** These are a newer type of API that is gaining popularity. They allow you to request only the data you need, which can be more efficient than REST APIs.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nAPIs can be used for a variety of tasks, including:\n\n*   Extracting data from sources that don't have a direct database connection.\n*   Building data pipelines that are triggered by events.\n*   Integrating with third-party services.\n"},{"slug":"data-extraction-101","title":"Data Extraction: The Art of Harvesting the Web","description":"Data is the new oil, but raw data is useless.

It's the **extraction and refinement** that creates value. As a Data Engineer, I don't just \"download files\"—I architect resilient, high-performance pipelines that turn the chaotic web into structured, actionable intelligence.\n\n## The Reality of Modern Scraping\n\nForget simple `curl` requests. The modern web is a complex beast of client-side rendering, anti-bot protections, and dynamic content. To extract data effectively at scale, you need more than a script; you need a strategy.\n\n### My Toolkit for Domination\n*   **Headless Browsers:** utilizing Playwright and Puppeteer to render JS-heavy apps just like a real user.\n*   **Reverse Engineering:** Inspecting network traffic to find hidden API endpoints, bypassing the UI entirely for 100x speed.\n*   **Intelligent Rotation:** Managing proxy pools and user-agents to blend in seamlessly.\n\n## Beyond the Basics\n\nAnyone can write a scraper. But building a **Data System** requires:\n1.  **Validation:** ensuring data integrity before it ever hits the database.\n2.  **Monitoring:** Tracking success rates and latency in real-time.\n3.  **Scalability:** Distributing extraction jobs across worker nodes to handle millions of requests.\n\nI build extractors that are **robust**, **stealthy**, and **efficient**. Whether it's financial market data, e-commerce pricing, or social sentiment, I get the data you need, when you need it.\n\n"},{"slug":"first-post","title":"How a Data Lake Works","description":"A practical explanation of modern data lakes.","content":"# How a Data Lake Works\n\nA practical explanation of modern data lakes.\n\n## Architecture\nAPI → S3 → Spark → Warehouse\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Storage is not analytics\n- Structure comes later"},{"slug":"full-stack-supremacy","title":"The Myth of \"Just a Backend Dev\"","description":"In the world of software, we love labels.

But labels are limiting. I believe in being a **Product Engineer**—someone who owns the outcome, not just a slice of the stack.\n\n## Why Full Stack Matters\n\nSpecialization is valuable, but versatility is a superpower.\n*   **Frontend:** Understanding React and UI/UX means I build data tools that people *actually want to use*.\n*   **Backend:** Knowing DB internals and API design ensures my frontends are fast and scalable.\n*   **Infrastructure:** Managing my own deployments (Docker, AWS, CI/CD) means I don't wait for \"Ops\" to unblock me. I ship.\n\n## Shipping is a Feature\n\nThe best code is the code that's in production helping users. My philosophy is simple: **Solve the problem, whatever tech it takes.**\nWhether it's a complex ETL pipeline in Python, a real-time dashboard in Next.js, or a serverless scraping bot, I build end-to-end solutions.\n\nI don't just move tickets. I move needles.\n"},{"slug":"introduction-to-data-lakes","title":"Introduction to Data Lakes","description":"A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale.","content":"# Introduction to Data Lakes\n\nA data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n*   **Schema-on-Read:** Unlike traditional data warehouses, data lakes use a schema-on-read approach. This means that you don't have to define a schema before you store the data.\n*   **Scalability:** Data lakes are designed to be highly scalable. You can store petabytes of data in a data lake.\n*   **Flexibility:** Data lakes can store data in any format, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nData lakes are used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n*   Big data analytics\n*   Machine learning\n*   Real-time data processing\n"}]
