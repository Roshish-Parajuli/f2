# APIs for Data Engineers

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a crucial tool for data engineers. They allow you to programmatically access data from various sources.

## Types of APIs

There are several types of APIs, but the most common are:

*   **REST APIs:** These are the most common type of API. They are based on the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style.
*   **GraphQL APIs:** These are a newer type of API that is gaining popularity. They allow you to request only the data you need, which can be more efficient than REST APIs.

## Use Cases

APIs can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

*   Extracting data from sources that don't have a direct database connection.
*   Building data pipelines that are triggered by events.
*   Integrating with third-party services.
