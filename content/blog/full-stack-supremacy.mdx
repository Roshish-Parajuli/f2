# The Myth of "Just a Backend Dev"

In the world of software, we love labels. Frontend. Backend. DevOps. Data Engineer. But labels are limiting. I believe in being a **Product Engineer**—someone who owns the outcome, not just a slice of the stack.

## Why Full Stack Matters

Specialization is valuable, but versatility is a superpower.
*   **Frontend:** Understanding React and UI/UX means I build data tools that people *actually want to use*.
*   **Backend:** Knowing DB internals and API design ensures my frontends are fast and scalable.
*   **Infrastructure:** Managing my own deployments (Docker, AWS, CI/CD) means I don't wait for "Ops" to unblock me. I ship.

## Shipping is a Feature

The best code is the code that's in production helping users. My philosophy is simple: **Solve the problem, whatever tech it takes.**
Whether it's a complex ETL pipeline in Python, a real-time dashboard in Next.js, or a serverless scraping bot, I build end-to-end solutions.

I don't just move tickets. I move needles.
