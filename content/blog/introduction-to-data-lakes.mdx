# Introduction to Data Lakes

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale.

## Key Concepts

*   **Schema-on-Read:** Unlike traditional data warehouses, data lakes use a schema-on-read approach. This means that you don't have to define a schema before you store the data.
*   **Scalability:** Data lakes are designed to be highly scalable. You can store petabytes of data in a data lake.
*   **Flexibility:** Data lakes can store data in any format, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

## Use Cases

Data lakes are used for a variety of purposes, including:

*   Big data analytics
*   Machine learning
*   Real-time data processing
