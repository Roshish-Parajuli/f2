They allow you to programmatically access data from various sources.\n\n## Types of APIs\n\nThere are several types of APIs, but the most common are:\n\n*   **REST APIs:** These are the most common type of API. They are based on the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style.\n*   **GraphQL APIs:** These are a newer type of API that is gaining popularity. They allow you to request only the data you need, which can be more efficient than REST APIs.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nAPIs can be used for a variety of tasks, including:\n\n*   Extracting data from sources that don't have a direct database connection.\n*   Building data pipelines that are triggered by events.\n*   Integrating with third-party services.\n"},{"slug":"data-extraction-101","title":"Data Extraction 101","description":"Data extraction is the process of retrieving data from various sources.

This means that you don't have to define a schema before you store the data.\n*   **Scalability:** Data lakes are designed to be highly scalable. You can store petabytes of data in a data lake.\n*   **Flexibility:** Data lakes can store data in any format, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nData lakes are used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n*   Big data analytics\n*   Machine learning\n*   Real-time data processing\n"}]}],null]]},["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","blog","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","styles":null}]]},[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","className":"__variable_b66e8e __variable_1278b4 scroll-smooth","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"bg-black text-white selection:bg-indigo-500/30 font-poppins","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col md:flex-row min-h-screen bg-black overflow-hidden relative","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"hidden md:block h-screen sticky top-0 z-50","children":["$","$L5",null,{}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"flex-1 h-screen overflow-y-auto w-full relative","children":["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":"404"}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"notFoundStyles":[],"styles":null}]}]]}]}]}],null]],[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/f2/_next/static/css/99fed6b3e02b583c.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":""}]],"$L6"]]]]
